# Cryptocurrency Boom



Bitcoin is a decentralized currency. There is no one server that stores the value of each bitcoin wallet. For example, your credit card purchases are stored on the Automated Clearing House, a US banking server. Everyone full BTC node stores every transaction ever. Bitcoin needs to achieve network consensus (everyone agrees) on the money people own. Instead of having a definite moment where a bitcoin transaction becomes final, a transaction is never final. However, the chance of reversal of a transaction is extremely low after about an hour after confirmation. Cryptocurrency is 100% anonymous, with no reliable way of tracking a personâ€™s identity in real life, no matter what they are doing on the network. This can be extremely valuable for some people, who consider their identity important, so it is benefit to cryptocurrency. However, this quality of the currency can also be negative because this makes it much easier for criminals to commit illegal acts, such as the buying and selling of illegal substances and weapons. Payments in cryptocurrency are often used on Dark Web websites such as The Silk Road. Another feature of cryptocurrency that is controversial is that cryptocurrency transactions are virtually impossible to refund once they go through, or are verified by the network. Notice that I say it is VIRTUALLY impossible. If someone had enough computer power, they could theoretically reverse a cryptocurrency transaction a few hours after it went through. However, it would never be worth it, due to the sheer amount of processing power needed. Some other benefits of cryptocurrency that are beneficial are that cryptocurrency cannot ever be counterfeited. Additionally, cryptocurrency solves the issue of different currencies with different values throughout the world. A cryptocurrency would have the same value no matter where you are.
