# KatKoin
KatKoin is a new type of cryptocurrency, similar to proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. If you are new to cryptocurrencies, look at a simple overview of cryptocurrencies [here](simple).  

## How is KatKoin different than other cryptocurrencies?
KatKoin uses an algorithm related to [Ethereum's Proof of Stake system](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ) to determine who can validate (also known as mine) the next block. In traditional proof of stake, the next validator is chosen based on their balance. If an address has a high balance, it has a high chance of validating the next block. However, someone cannot validate a block if their computer isn't on. This causes people to leave their computer on. Doing this contributes to the network. The difference between traditional proof of stake and KatKoin's proof of stake is that an address must burn coins first. Burning coins is analagous to purchasing a lottery ticket.
